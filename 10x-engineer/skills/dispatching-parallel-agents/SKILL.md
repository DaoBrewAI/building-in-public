# Dispatching Parallel Agents

## Overview

When you have multiple unrelated failures (different test files, different subsystems, different bugs), investigating them sequentially wastes time. Each investigation is independent and can happen in parallel.

**Core principle:** Dispatch one agent per independent problem domain. Let them work concurrently.

## When to Use

**Use when:**
- 2+ tasks with different root causes or domains
- Multiple subsystems broken independently
- Each problem can be understood without context from others
- No shared state between investigations

**Don't use when:**
- Failures are related (fix one might fix others)
- Need to understand full system state
- Agents would interfere with each other (editing same files)

## Simple Parallel Dispatch (2-3 Tasks)

### 1. Identify Independent Domains

Group failures by what's broken:
- File A tests: Tool approval flow
- File B tests: Batch completion behavior
- File C tests: Abort functionality

### 2. Create Focused Agent Tasks

Each agent gets:
- **Specific scope:** One test file or subsystem
- **Clear goal:** Make these tests pass
- **Constraints:** Don't change other code
- **Expected output:** Summary of what you found and fixed

### 3. Dispatch in Parallel

Use `spawn_agent` once per domain before waiting, so all independent tasks run
concurrently. Give each agent a stable task name, the minimum required context,
and explicit file ownership.

### 4. Review and Integrate

When agents return:
- Read each summary
- Verify fixes don't conflict
- Run full test suite
- Integrate all changes

## Coordinated Mode (4+ Tasks or Dependencies)

When Codex collaboration tools are available and you have many independent
tasks or need inter-agent communication:

1. Model dependencies and file ownership in `update_plan`.
2. Spawn only the currently unblocked tasks, up to the available concurrency.
3. Use `send_message` for non-blocking guidance and `followup_task` for another turn.
4. Use `wait_agent` or `list_agents` to collect status.
5. Stop or close agents when their bounded task is complete.

## Agent Prompt Structure

Good agent prompts are:
1. **Focused** - One clear problem domain
2. **Self-contained** - All context needed to understand the problem
3. **Specific about output** - What should the agent return?

## Common Mistakes

- **Too broad:** "Fix all the tests" - agent gets lost
- **No context:** "Fix the race condition" - agent doesn't know where
- **No constraints:** Agent might refactor everything
- **Vague output:** "Fix it" - you don't know what changed

## When NOT to Use

**Related failures:** Fixing one might fix others - investigate together first
**Need full context:** Understanding requires seeing entire system
**Exploratory debugging:** You don't know what's broken yet
**Shared state:** Agents would interfere (editing same files, using same resources)

## Verification

After agents return (either mode):
1. **Review each summary** - Understand what changed
2. **Check for conflicts** - Did agents edit same code?
3. **Run full suite** - Verify all fixes work together
4. **Spot check** - Agents can make systematic errors
